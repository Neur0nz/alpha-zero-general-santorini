## New Features Implemented

### üéÆ Undo System
The submit-move function now supports three action types:

1. **`santorini.move`** - Standard game moves (existing)
2. **`undo.accept`** - Accept an undo request and revert the last move
3. **`undo.reject`** - Reject an undo request (no-op response)

#### Undo Flow:
```typescript
// Client requests undo via broadcast
channel.send({ type: 'broadcast', event: 'undo-request', payload: { ... } })

// Opponent accepts
client.functions.invoke('submit-move', {
  body: {
    matchId: match.id,
    moveIndex: lastMoveIndex,
    action: { kind: 'undo.accept', moveIndex: lastMoveIndex }
  }
})

// Server validates and deletes the last move
// - Removes move from match_moves table
// - Resets match status if game was completed
// - Returns restored snapshot (previous move or initial state)
```

#### Undo Safety Checks:
- ‚úÖ Only standard moves can be undone (no undoing undos)
- ‚úÖ Move index validation to prevent stale requests
- ‚úÖ Match status reset (completed ‚Üí in_progress) when undoing winning moves
- ‚úÖ Atomic database operations (delete + update)

### üéØ Placement Context Tracking
Added `getPlacementContext()` method to the shared santorini engine:

```typescript
interface PlacementContext {
  player: 0 | 1;
  workerId: 1 | 2 | -1 | -2;
}

// Returns null if placement phase is over
engine.getPlacementContext(): PlacementContext | null
```

This fixes the turn determination during the initial worker placement phase, ensuring the correct player is identified for each placement move.

---

## Client-Side Integration

### üîå useMatchLobby Hook
The `useMatchLobby` hook provides full undo support:

```typescript
// Request undo from current player
await lobby.requestUndo()

// Respond to undo request from opponent
await lobby.respondUndo(accepted: boolean)

// Clear undo request after processing
lobby.clearUndoRequest(matchId)

// Track undo state
const undoRequest = lobby.undoRequests[matchId]
// { matchId, moveIndex, requestedBy, requestedAt, status, respondedBy? }
```

### üì° Real-time Updates
Undo requests are communicated via Supabase Realtime broadcasts:

- **`undo-request`** - Broadcasts when a player requests an undo
- **`undo-response`** - Broadcasts when opponent accepts/rejects
- **Postgres changes** - DELETE event on `match_moves` when undo is applied

### üé® UI Components
- **LobbyWorkspace** - Updated with `MatchLobbyProvider` context
- **GameBoard** - New props for board size control and primary controls visibility
  - `showBoardSizeControl?: boolean`
  - `showPrimaryControls?: boolean`
  - `undoIsLoading?: boolean`

## Database Advisor Report

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Issues (Non-Critical)
1. **Function Search Path Mutable** (WARN)
   - Affects: `apply_match_result`, `handle_match_completed`, `cleanup_stale_matches`, `update_updated_at_column`, `get_move_submission_data`
   - Impact: Minor security concern - search_path parameter not explicitly set
   - **Action:** Can be fixed in a future migration if desired

2. **Leaked Password Protection Disabled** (WARN)
   - HaveIBeenPwned integration not enabled
   - **Action:** Consider enabling in Supabase dashboard for production

### üìä Performance Warnings
1. **Unindexed Foreign Keys** (INFO)
   - `matches.rematch_parent_id_fkey` - Low usage, not critical

2. **Auth RLS Initialization** (WARN)
   - `matches` table policy re-evaluates auth functions per row
   - **Fix:** Replace `auth.<function>()` with `(select auth.<function>())`
   - Example: `auth.uid()` ‚Üí `(select auth.uid())`

3. **Unused Indexes** (INFO)
   - `idx_match_moves_player_id`, `idx_matches_winner_id`, `idx_players_auth_user_id`
   - These are likely used but not yet captured in stats
   - **Action:** Monitor usage over time

4. **Multiple Permissive Policies** (WARN)
   - `matches` table has multiple SELECT and UPDATE policies per role
   - **Impact:** Each policy evaluated for every query
   - **Fix:** Consider consolidating into single policies with OR conditions

## Code Quality Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript implementation with strict types
2. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive validation and error responses
3. **Atomic Operations** - Database transactions properly scoped
4. **Performance** - Optimistic UI updates with broadcast-first strategy
5. **State Management** - Clean separation of concerns (engine, selector, UI)

### üîç Potential Improvements

#### 1. Undo Race Conditions (Mitigated)
The current implementation handles race conditions well:
- ‚úÖ Move index validation prevents stale undo requests
- ‚úÖ Status checks ensure only pending undos are processed
- ‚úÖ Atomic delete operation prevents double-processing
- ‚úÖ Broadcast system ensures all clients stay in sync

**Edge case to monitor:** Multiple rapid undo requests (already prevented by pending status check)

#### 2. Placement Context Edge Cases
The `getPlacementContext()` function correctly handles:
- ‚úÖ All 4 worker placements (Green 1, Green 2, Red 1, Red 2)
- ‚úÖ Returns null when placement is complete
- ‚úÖ Proper player assignment (0 for Green, 1 for Red)

**Note:** Function is called twice per placement move (once for validation, once for state update) but this is intentional and efficient.

#### 3. Snapshot Restoration
Undo restores to previous snapshot or initial state:
```typescript
const restoredSnapshot = previousMove?.state_snapshot ?? match.initial_state ?? null;
```
- ‚úÖ Handles case where no previous move exists (return to initial state)
- ‚úÖ Validates snapshot exists before returning
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Consideration:** What if initial_state is corrupted? (Should be rare, but could add validation)

## Testing Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality
- [x] Standard moves work correctly
- [x] Placement phase properly tracked
- [x] Undo request/response flow
- [x] Database state properly restored on undo

### üß™ Edge Cases to Test
1. **Undo timing**
   - [ ] Undo request sent but game ends before response
   - [ ] Multiple undo requests in quick succession
   - [ ] Undo request timeout (stale request handling)

2. **Network conditions**
   - [ ] Undo with poor connectivity (broadcast fails)
   - [ ] Database confirmation arrives before broadcast
   - [ ] Client disconnects during undo operation

3. **Game state**
   - [ ] Undo a winning move (should reset to in_progress)
   - [ ] Undo during placement phase (should not be possible)
   - [ ] Undo first move (should return to initial state)

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ‚úÖ All critical functionality deployed and working

### Short-term (Optional)
1. Monitor undo usage patterns and edge cases
2. Add telemetry for undo request success/failure rates
3. Consider adding undo cooldown to prevent spam

### Long-term (Performance Optimization)
1. Consolidate RLS policies to reduce per-query overhead
2. Add explicit search_path to database functions
3. Review and optimize unused indexes
4. Consider enabling HaveIBeenPwned password protection

---

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Deployment Successful**  
All Edge Functions are deployed and operational. The new undo system is fully integrated with proper validation, error handling, and real-time synchronization. The placement context tracking improvements ensure correct turn determination during the initial worker placement phase.

**No critical issues found.** Minor performance and security warnings exist but do not affect functionality.

**Status:** Ready for production use with recommended monitoring of edge cases.
