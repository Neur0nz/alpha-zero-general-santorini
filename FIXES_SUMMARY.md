# Fixes Summary - ELO, Resign, Abort, and Play Tab Bug

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the issues with ELO rating updates, player resignation, abort requests, and the Play tab loading bug.

---

## ✅ Issue 1: ELO Rating Not Updating When Players Leave

### Problem
When a player left a match, the status was set to `'abandoned'`, but the database trigger `handle_match_completed()` only fired for `'completed'` status. This meant ELO ratings were not updated when someone resigned.

### Solution
**Database Migration:** `fix_elo_for_resigned_matches`

Updated the `handle_match_completed()` trigger function to handle both `'completed'` AND `'abandoned'` statuses:

```sql
create or replace function public.handle_match_completed()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer
as $$
begin
  -- Apply ELO when match transitions to 'completed' OR 'abandoned' (resignation)
  if (new.status = 'completed' or new.status = 'abandoned') 
     and (old.status is distinct from 'completed' and old.status is distinct from 'abandoned') then
    perform public.apply_match_result(new.id);
  end if;
  return new;
end;
$$;
```

**Result:** ELO ratings now update correctly when players resign from rated matches.

## ✅ Issue 2: Rename "Leave" Button to "Resign"

### Problem
The button was labeled "Leave" which didn't clearly communicate that it would result in a loss.

### Solution
- Updated button text from "Leave match" to "Resign" in `PlayWorkspace.tsx`
- Updated button text from "Leave" to "Resign" in `GamePlayWorkspace.tsx`
- Added tooltips: "Resign and lose the game (affects rating if rated)"

### Files Changed
- `/web/src/components/play/PlayWorkspace.tsx`
- `/web/src/components/play/GamePlayWorkspace.tsx`

---

## ✅ Issue 3: Abort Request Feature (Backend Complete, UI Minimal)

### Problem
Users needed a way to mutually abort a game without affecting ratings, distinct from resigning.

### Solution - Backend (Complete)

**Database Migration:** `add_abort_request_feature`

1. **Created `abort_requests` table:**
   - Stores abort requests with status tracking (pending/accepted/rejected/expired)
   - Only one pending request per match (enforced by unique index)
   - Row Level Security policies for players to create and respond

2. **Created `handle_abort_accepted()` trigger:**
   - Automatically updates match status to 'abandoned' with `winner_id = null` when abort is accepted
   - Since `apply_match_result()` returns early when `winner_id is null`, no rating changes occur

3. **Added to `useMatchLobby` hook:**
   - `requestAbort()` - Create abort request in database and broadcast
   - `respondAbort()` - Accept or reject abort request
   - `clearAbortRequest()` - Clear abort request state
   - Added `abortRequests` to state tracking

4. **Updated types in `/web/src/types/match.ts`:**
   - `AbortRequestAction`
   - `AbortResponseAction`
   - `AbortRequestRecord`

### Solution - Frontend (Minimal)

The abort feature is fully functional in the backend and hook layer, but the UI implementation is minimal:
- Hooks are available via `useMatchLobby`: `requestAbort`, `respondAbort`, `abortRequests`
- No UI buttons added yet to maintain simplicity
- Can be enhanced later with alert-based UI similar to undo requests

### How It Works
1. Player A calls `requestAbort()` → Creates database record and broadcasts to Player B
2. Player B sees request (when UI is implemented) and calls `respondAbort(true)` to accept
3. Database trigger sets match status to 'abandoned' with `winner_id = null`
4. Since `winner_id` is null, `apply_match_result()` returns early and no ELO changes occur

## ✅ Issue 4: Play Tab Bug - "Join a match first"

### Problem
When a user navigated to the Play tab with an active game:
1. The `activeMatchId` was restored from localStorage immediately
2. The board rendered with the game state
3. BUT the full match data (including opponent info) was still being fetched from the database
4. During this loading period, `role` was `null`
5. User clicks on board → Error: "Join a match first"

### Root Cause
The check in `useOnlineSantorini.ts` `onCellClick`:
```typescript
if (!match || !role) {
  toast({ title: 'Join a match first', status: 'info' });
  return;
}
```

This was too strict and didn't handle the loading state gracefully.

### Solution
**File:** `/web/src/hooks/useOnlineSantorini.ts`

Updated the check to distinguish between "no match" and "match loading":

```typescript
if (!match) {
  // Match is still loading, silently ignore clicks
  return;
}
if (!role) {
  toast({ title: 'Loading match...', status: 'info' });
  return;
}
```

**Result:**
- Silent during initial load (no confusing errors)
- Shows "Loading match..." if role isn't determined yet
- Board becomes interactive as soon as match data is fully loaded

## Testing Recommendations

### ELO Rating (Issue #1)
1. Create a rated match
2. Make a few moves
3. Have one player resign (click "Resign" button)
4. Check database: `select id, display_name, rating, games_played from players where id in ('<player1_id>', '<player2_id>');`
5. Verify that both players' ratings were updated

### Resign Button (Issue #2)
1. Start any online match
2. Verify button says "Resign" (not "Leave")
3. Hover over button - should show tooltip about rating impact

### Play Tab Loading (Issue #4)
1. Start a match and make a move
2. Refresh the page
3. Click on "Play" tab
4. The board should load with the current game state
5. Click on the board immediately - should either:
   - Work immediately if match loaded fast
   - Show "Loading match..." briefly
   - NOT show "Join a match first"

### Abort Feature (Issue #3 - Backend Only)
To test the backend (requires manual integration):
```javascript
// In browser console after loading a match
const { requestAbort, respondAbort, abortRequests } = lobby;

// Player 1 requests abort
await requestAbort();

// Player 2 accepts (simulated)
await respondAbort(true);

// Check match status - should be 'abandoned' with winner_id = null
// Check ratings - should be unchanged
```

## Database Migrations Applied

1. `fix_elo_for_resigned_matches` - Updated trigger to handle abandoned matches
2. `add_abort_request_feature` - Complete abort request system

Both migrations are **idempotent** and safe to run multiple times.

## Future Enhancements

### Abort Feature UI (Low Priority)
- Add "Request Abort" button next to "Resign"
- Show alert when opponent requests abort (similar to undo requests)
- Allow player to accept/decline with buttons
- Show status messages for accepted/rejected requests

### Additional Improvements
- Add confirmation dialog before resigning (to prevent accidental clicks)
- Show rating change preview before resigning in rated games
- Add game history with resignation/abort reasons
