## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

### Problem: Moves still slow (>500ms)

**Check:**
```javascript
// Console should show:
⚡ Broadcasting move to all players...
⚡ Move broadcast in 67ms - INSTANT!

// If you see this instead:
🔒 Submitting move via SECURE edge function...
🔒 Move validated and submitted in 1600ms

// Then: Broadcasts aren't working
```

**Fix:** Make sure you've refreshed the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Problem: Moves appear then disappear

**This is normal if:**
- You moved out of turn
- Move was illegal
- Race condition (both clicked fast)

**Check console for:**
```
❌ Move rejected by server after 1543ms!
```
