### 3. **Clear Call-to-Action Buttons**
**Before:** Forms and inputs everywhere
**After:** Two clear buttons:

- **"Join by Code"** (Secondary action, outline button)

**Benefits:**
- Clear user flow
- Professional appearance
- Intuitive hierarchy

### 4. **Better Information Architecture**
**New Layout:**
```
