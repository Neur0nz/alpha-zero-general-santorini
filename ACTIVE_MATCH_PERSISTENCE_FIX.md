# Active Match Persistence Fix

## Problem

After joining a game from the Lobby tab and being redirected to the Play tab:
- ✅ The board displays correctly
- ❌ The game isn't fully "active" (rematch button disabled, etc.)
- ❌ User must manually click the game in "Your Active Games" to activate it

## Root Cause

### Architecture Issue: Separate Hook Instances

```typescript
// App.tsx line 208
<Tabs isLazy ...>
  <TabPanel>
    <LobbyWorkspace auth={auth} /> {/* Has its own useMatchLobby() */}
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel>
    <GamePlayWorkspace auth={auth} /> {/* Has a DIFFERENT useMatchLobby() */}
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>
```

The `isLazy` prop keeps both tab panels mounted once visited, so both components stay alive. However, each has its **own** `useMatchLobby` hook instance with **separate state**!

### The Broken Flow

1. User joins match in Lobby tab
2. `LobbyWorkspace.useMatchLobby()` sets `activeMatchId` in **its** state
3. User is redirected to Play tab (`onNavigateToPlay()`)
4. `GamePlayWorkspace` has a **different** `useMatchLobby()` instance
5. This instance's state has `activeMatchId: null`
6. Game displays (from `myMatches`) but isn't "active"
7. User must click to set active match in **this** instance

## The Solution

Persist `activeMatchId` in `localStorage` so all hook instances stay synchronized.

### Implementation

#### 1. Initialize with Stored Value

```typescript
const ACTIVE_MATCH_STORAGE_KEY = 'santorini:activeMatchId';

export function useMatchLobby(profile: PlayerProfile | null, options: UseMatchLobbyOptions = {}) {
  const [state, setState] = useState<UseMatchLobbyState>(() => {
    // Restore active match ID from localStorage
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      try {
        const stored = window.localStorage.getItem(ACTIVE_MATCH_STORAGE_KEY);
        if (stored) {
          return { ...INITIAL_STATE, activeMatchId: stored };
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to restore active match from localStorage', error);
      }
    }
    return INITIAL_STATE;
  });
```

#### 2. Persist on Change

```typescript
  // Persist active match ID to localStorage whenever it changes
  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window === 'undefined') return;
    try {
      if (state.activeMatchId) {
        window.localStorage.setItem(ACTIVE_MATCH_STORAGE_KEY, state.activeMatchId);
      } else {
        window.localStorage.removeItem(ACTIVE_MATCH_STORAGE_KEY);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to persist active match to localStorage', error);
    }
  }, [state.activeMatchId]);
```

#### 3. Existing Logic Handles Rehydration

The existing code (lines 390-399) already handles finding the match object:

```typescript
setState((prev) => {
  const myMatches = hydrated;
  const activeMatchId = (() => {
    // If we have a stored activeMatchId and it exists in myMatches, keep it!
    if (prev.activeMatchId && myMatches.some((match) => match.id === prev.activeMatchId)) {
      return prev.activeMatchId;
    }
    // Otherwise, select preferred match
    const preferred = selectPreferredMatch(myMatches);
    return preferred?.id ?? null;
  })();
  const activeMatch = activeMatchId
    ? myMatches.find((match) => match.id === activeMatchId) ?? prev.activeMatch
    : null;
  return {
    ...prev,
    myMatches,
    activeMatchId,
    activeMatch,
    joinCode: activeMatchId ? activeMatch?.private_join_code ?? prev.joinCode : null,
  };
});
```

## How It Works Now

### Flow After Fix

1. User joins match in Lobby tab
2. `LobbyWorkspace.useMatchLobby()` sets `activeMatchId` in state
3. Effect writes `activeMatchId` to localStorage
4. User is redirected to Play tab
5. `GamePlayWorkspace.useMatchLobby()` initializes with stored `activeMatchId`
6. When `myMatches` loads, it finds the match with that ID
7. Sets both `activeMatchId` and `activeMatch` object
8. Game is fully active! ✅

### Cross-Tab Synchronization Bonus

Because we're using localStorage, the active match even syncs across browser tabs! If you join a game in one tab and open another tab, both see the same active match.

## Benefits

1. **Seamless UX** - Join game → redirect → game is immediately active
2. **No extra clicks** - User doesn't need to click on "Your Active Games"
3. **Cross-tab sync** - Active match persists across browser tabs
4. **Survives refresh** - Active match survives page reloads
5. **Clean architecture** - No need to lift state to App level

## Testing

### Before Fix
```
1. Join game from Lobby tab
2. Redirected to Play tab
3. Board displays ✅
4. Rematch button disabled ❌
5. Must click game in sidebar ❌
```

### After Fix
```
1. Join game from Lobby tab
2. Redirected to Play tab
3. Board displays ✅
4. Rematch button active ✅
5. Game fully interactive ✅
```

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### 1. Lift useMatchLobby to App Level
```typescript
// App.tsx
const lobby = useMatchLobby(auth.profile);

<LobbyWorkspace lobby={lobby} />
<GamePlayWorkspace lobby={lobby} />
```

**Pros:** Single source of truth, no sync needed  
**Cons:** Requires refactoring all components, more coupling

### 2. URL Params
```typescript
// ?activeMatch=<id>
```

**Pros:** Shareable links  
**Cons:** More complex, affects routing, not needed for this use case

### 3. React Context
```typescript
const MatchLobbyContext = createContext(...);
```

**Pros:** Proper React pattern for shared state  
**Cons:** Overkill for this simple case, more boilerplate

**Chosen:** localStorage - Simple, effective, provides cross-tab sync bonus

## Build Status

✅ Build succeeds without errors  
✅ TypeScript compilation passes  
✅ No linter errors

## Files Modified

- `web/src/hooks/useMatchLobby.ts` - Added localStorage persistence

## Compatibility

- ✅ Works with server-side rendering (guards for `window`)
- ✅ Handles localStorage errors gracefully
- ✅ Backwards compatible (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Works with existing match selection logic

## Future Improvements

Consider:
- Add state version checking for multiple tabs (prevent conflicts)
- Expire stored matchId after some time period
- Clear stored matchId when match ends
- Add telemetry to track how often this helps users

## Summary

Fixed the UX issue where joining a game required an extra click to fully activate it. Now when you join from Lobby and redirect to Play, the game is immediately active with all functionality working (rematch button, etc.).

The fix uses localStorage to synchronize the `activeMatchId` across different `useMatchLobby` hook instances, ensuring a seamless experience without requiring major architectural changes.
