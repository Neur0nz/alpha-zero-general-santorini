# Turn Enforcement - Real Fix

## The Issue

**User could still move BOTH Blue and Red pieces**, even with "You vs AI" mode selected (which should only allow moving Blue pieces).

## Root Cause

The turn enforcement was relying on `game.is_human_player('next')` from the Python game object, but:
1. Python game might not be fully synced when the check runs
2. The function depends on Python state which could be stale
3. Not reliable immediately after moves or during rapid state changes

**The code was checking the WRONG source of truth!**

‚ùå **Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// Relied on Python game state
const isHumanTurn = game.is_human_player('next');
```

This would sometimes return wrong values or not work at all because the Python game state wasn't always synced.

---

## The Fix

**Use the TypeScript engine's current player directly** - it's the source of truth!

‚úÖ **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Use TypeScript engine directly
const currentPlayer = engine.player; // 0 or 1 (from TypeScript!)

let isHumanTurn = false;

if (game.gameMode === 'P0') {
  // "You vs AI" - Human is Player 0 (Blue)
  isHumanTurn = currentPlayer === 0;
} else if (game.gameMode === 'P1') {
  // "AI vs You" - Human is Player 1 (Red)
  isHumanTurn = currentPlayer === 1;
} else if (game.gameMode === 'AI') {
  // "WarGames" - Both are AI
  isHumanTurn = false;
}

if (!isHumanTurn) {
  toast({ title: "It's the AI's turn", status: 'info' });
  return; // Block move!
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Game Modes & Turn Enforcement

| Mode | Game Mode Value | Player 0 (Blue) | Player 1 (Red) |
|------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **You vs AI** | `'P0'` | Human ‚úÖ | AI (blocked) ‚õî |
| **AI vs You** | `'P1'` | AI (blocked) ‚õî | Human ‚úÖ |
| **No AI** | `'Human'` | Human ‚úÖ | Human ‚úÖ |
| **WarGames** | `'AI'` | AI (blocked) ‚õî | AI (blocked) ‚õî |

### Turn Check Logic

```typescript
// Step 1: Get current player from TypeScript engine (source of truth)
const currentPlayer = engine.player; // 0 = Blue, 1 = Red

// Step 2: Check game mode
if (game.gameMode === 'P0') {
  // "You vs AI" selected
  // Human controls Blue (Player 0), AI controls Red (Player 1)
  isHumanTurn = (currentPlayer === 0);
}

// Step 3: Block if not human's turn
if (!isHumanTurn) {
  // Show toast and exit early
  return;
}
```

---

## What Changed

### 1. Turn Enforcement in `onCellClick`

**Before:**
```typescript
const isHumanTurn = game.is_human_player('next'); // ‚ùå Python state
```

**After:**
```typescript
const currentPlayer = engine.player; // ‚úÖ TypeScript state

let isHumanTurn = false;
if (game.gameMode === 'P0') {
  isHumanTurn = currentPlayer === 0;
} else if (game.gameMode === 'P1') {
  isHumanTurn = currentPlayer === 1;
} else if (game.gameMode === 'AI') {
  isHumanTurn = false;
}
```

### 2. Highlighting in `syncEngineToUi`

**Before:**
```typescript
const isHumanTurn = game.is_human_player('next'); // ‚ùå Python state
```

**After:**
```typescript
const currentPlayer = snapshot.player; // ‚úÖ TypeScript state

let isHumanTurn = true;
if (game && game.gameMode && game.gameMode !== 'Human') {
  if (game.gameMode === 'P0') {
    isHumanTurn = currentPlayer === 0;
  } else if (game.gameMode === 'P1') {
    isHumanTurn = currentPlayer === 1;
  } else if (game.gameMode === 'AI') {
    isHumanTurn = false;
  }
}
```

## Why This Works

### TypeScript Engine = Single Source of Truth

```
User clicks piece
    ‚Üì
Check: engine.player === human's player?
    ‚Üì                          ‚Üì
   Yes                        No
    ‚Üì                          ‚Üì
Allow move              Block with toast
```

**Key Points:**
1. ‚úÖ TypeScript engine always has current player state
2. ‚úÖ No dependency on Python sync state
3. ‚úÖ Immediate, reliable checks
4. ‚úÖ Works right after moves and state changes

## Testing

### You vs AI (Default - P0 Mode)

**Your Turn (Player 0 = Blue):**
- ‚úÖ Blue pieces highlighted
- ‚úÖ Can click and move Blue pieces
- ‚úÖ Clicking Red pieces ‚Üí **BLOCKED** ‚õî
- ‚úÖ Toast: "It's the AI's turn"

**AI's Turn (Player 1 = Red):**
- ‚úÖ No pieces highlighted
- ‚úÖ Cannot click any pieces
- ‚úÖ AI automatically makes Red move
- ‚úÖ Back to your turn

### AI vs You (P1 Mode)

**AI's Turn (Player 0 = Blue):**
- ‚úÖ No pieces highlighted
- ‚úÖ AI automatically makes Blue move (first move)

**Your Turn (Player 1 = Red):**
- ‚úÖ Red pieces highlighted
- ‚úÖ Can click and move Red pieces only
- ‚úÖ Clicking Blue pieces ‚Üí **BLOCKED** ‚õî

## Summary

**The Problem:**
- Used `game.is_human_player('next')` which relied on Python game state
- Python state could be stale or not synced
- Turn enforcement didn't work consistently

**The Solution:**
- Use `engine.player` from TypeScript engine (source of truth)
- Compare against game mode to determine if human's turn
- Reliable, immediate checks that always work

**Result:**
‚úÖ **"You vs AI"** - Can ONLY move Blue pieces (Player 0)
‚úÖ **"AI vs You"** - Can ONLY move Red pieces (Player 1)
‚úÖ **Immediate blocking** with clear feedback
‚úÖ **No stale state issues**

**NOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS!** üéâ
