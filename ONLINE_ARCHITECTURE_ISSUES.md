# Online Architecture Issues

## Issue 1: Why Load Python Engine for Online Matches? ü§î

### Current Architecture (Inefficient)

**What happens now:**
1. Player joins online match
2. Browser loads **full Python engine** (Pyodide + numpy ‚âà 200MB)
3. Client imports game snapshots and replays moves locally
4. Client validates moves client-side
5. Client sends validated moves to server
6. Server validates again and persists

**Code Evidence:**
```typescript
// useOnlineSantorini.ts
const base = useSantorini({ evaluationEnabled: false });  // ‚Üê Loads full engine!

await base.importState(snapshot);         // ‚Üê Calls Python
await base.applyMove(action.move, {...}); // ‚Üê Calls Python
await base.onCellClick(y, x);             // ‚Üê Calls Python
```

**Why this is inefficient:**
- ‚ùå Downloads ~200MB of Python runtime for online matches
- ‚ùå Duplicates game logic (client + server both validate)
- ‚ùå Slow initial load ("Loading numpy...")
- ‚ùå Unnecessary computation on client
- ‚ùå Increases bundle size and memory usage

### What SHOULD Happen (Server-Authoritative)

**Ideal architecture:**
1. Player joins online match
2. Browser only loads **UI rendering code** (lightweight)
3. Client receives board state from server
4. Player clicks ‚Üí Send coordinates to server
5. Server validates and applies move
6. Server broadcasts new state to both players
7. Clients render the updated board

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No Python download needed for online matches
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth (server)
- ‚úÖ Fast load times
- ‚úÖ Smaller bundle size
- ‚úÖ Better mobile experience

### Why Current Architecture Was Chosen

The hybrid approach exists to provide:
1. **Immediate feedback** - Client knows if a move is valid before server response
2. **Selectable cells** - Client can highlight valid moves
3. **State synchronization** - Replaying moves to catch up
4. **Optimistic UI** - Show move immediately, confirm later

### Recommendation

**Short-term (current):**
- Keep the hybrid approach for now (it works)
- Fix the immediate bugs (duplicate submissions, race conditions)

**Long-term (future refactor):**
Create a lightweight online-only board renderer:
```typescript
interface OnlineBoardRenderer {
  board: BoardCell[][];           // Just rendering state
  selectableCells: boolean[][];   // From server
  renderBoard(): JSX.Element;     
  onClick(y, x): void;            // Send to server, no local validation
}
```

Server response includes:
```typescript
{
  board_state: [...],
  valid_moves: [true, false, ...],  // Pre-computed by server
  next_player: 0,
  game_ended: [0, 0]
}
```

**Estimated savings:**
- ~200MB less download per player
- ~2-3 seconds faster initial load
- ~100MB less memory usage

## Issue 2: Duplicate Move Submissions üêõ

### Problem

From the console logs:
```
useOnlineSantorini.ts:357 Submitting move to server {moveIndex: 1, move: 22, by: 'creator'}
useOnlineSantorini.ts:357 Submitting move to server {moveIndex: 1, move: 17, by: 'creator'}
POST .../submit-move 422 (Unprocessable Content)
```

**Both moves trying to use `moveIndex: 1`** ‚Üí Server rejects the second one

### Root Cause

When placing pieces quickly (e.g., initial worker placement), the race condition is:

1. Click first cell ‚Üí `onCellClick(y1, x1)`
   - Sets `pendingLocalMoveRef = { expectedMoveIndex: 1 }`
   - Applies move locally
   - Triggers submission effect

2. Click second cell ‚Üí `onCellClick(y2, x2)` (before first submission completes)
   - Calculates `nextMoveIndex = moves.length` (still 1!)
   - Sets `pendingLocalMoveRef = { expectedMoveIndex: 1 }` ‚Üê Same index!
   - Applies move locally
   - Triggers submission effect again

3. Both submissions run in parallel with `moveIndex: 1`
4. Server accepts first, rejects second with 422

### Current Fix Attempt

```typescript
// Calculate the correct move index based on existing moves + pending moves
const pendingCount = pendingLocalMoveRef.current ? 1 : 0;
const nextMoveIndex = moves.length + pendingCount;
```

**Problem with this fix:**
- Only accounts for ONE pending move
- If user clicks twice quickly, still has race condition
- Doesn't prevent the effect from running multiple times

### Proper Fix

Need to prevent overlapping submissions using a submission queue or lock:

```typescript
const submissionLockRef = useRef<boolean>(false);

// In move submission effect:
if (submissionLockRef.current) {
  return; // Another submission in progress
}

submissionLockRef.current = true;

try {
  await onSubmitMove(...);
} finally {
  submissionLockRef.current = false;
}
```

**Alternative: Move index counter**
```typescript
const nextMoveIndexRef = useRef(0);

// In onCellClick:
const nextMoveIndex = nextMoveIndexRef.current;
nextMoveIndexRef.current++;

// After server confirms (in real-time handler):
nextMoveIndexRef.current = moves.length;  // Resync with server
```

## Issue 3: Are Updates Being Pushed Correctly? üì°

### Real-time Subscription Status

From logs:
```
useMatchLobby.ts:577 Real-time subscription status {status: 'SUBSCRIBED'}
useMatchLobby.ts:589 Real-time subscription active, refreshing match state
useMatchLobby.ts:540 Real-time move received {eventType: 'INSERT', moveId: '...', moveIndex: 1}
useMatchLobby.ts:561 Adding new move {moveId: '...', moveIndex: 1, totalMoves: 2}
useOnlineSantorini.ts:180 Syncing state {movesCount: 2}
```

**Good news:** ‚úÖ Real-time is working!
- Subscription is active
- Moves are being received
- State is syncing

**But:** The duplicate submission causes confusion because:
1. Player 1 submits move #1 (succeeds)
2. Player 1 submits move #2 with index 1 (fails with 422)
3. Player 1 receives move #1 via real-time
4. Player 2 never sees move #2 (because it failed server-side)

### Testing Real-time

To verify both players see moves:

**Player 1 (Creator):**
1. Place first piece
2. Wait for confirmation
3. Check Player 2's screen

**Player 2 (Opponent):**
1. Should see Player 1's piece appear
2. Console should show: "Real-time move received"
3. Board should update

**Current issue:**
- If Player 1 clicks too fast, second move fails
- Player 2 only sees successfully submitted moves
- Appears like moves aren't syncing (but real-time works, submissions fail)

## Summary

| Issue | Status | Priority | Complexity |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Loading Python for online | üü° Inefficient but works | Medium | High (refactor) |
| Duplicate move submissions | üî¥ Broken | **HIGH** | Low (add lock) |
| Real-time subscription | ‚úÖ Working | - | - |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix duplicate submission bug with lock
2. **Short-term:** Add better error handling and retry logic
3. **Long-term:** Consider lightweight online renderer (major refactor)

The real-time system is working correctly - the issue is that rapid clicks cause submission failures, making it *appear* like moves aren't syncing.
